# Uber Data Analysis

This project file focuses on the data analysis of Uber drives. The project includes various stages of data analysis such as data importation, cleaning, transformation, and augmentation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Importation**: The data is imported using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**: This step involves handling missing values to ensure data quality.

3. **Data Transformation**: This includes converting date strings to datetime objects for easier manipulation.

4. **Data Augmentation**: This involves adding new time-related columns to enrich the dataset.

The dataset contains information on start and end times of trips, categories (e.g., business), start and stop locations, miles covered, and trip purpose.

## Libraries Used

The project uses several Python libraries:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- `calendar` for date-related functions
